# hello-world.
my first git

Always wanted to learn programming languages, one day make career out of it if possible. Never seemed like I had the time to sit and lear though.
Quarantine changed that. I've taken some basic courses on Udemy. Trying to work my way up. Hopefully have a program up or a start for guidance soon
